Darwin Day in Knoxville, Tennessee is a volunteer-run event dedicated to informing the public about evolution and its importance as a unifying concept in all of biology. Our goal is to disseminate factual information, in the context of a non-confrontational and rational discussion based on empirical evidence without pre-conceived ideological agendas or uncritical faith in the opinions of scientists, politicians, or clerics. In a state with past and recent legislative efforts to introduce faith-based ideologies into the science classrooms of public schools, these efforts are particularly important.

We sponsored our first Darwin Day event on February 12th of 1997, the 188th birthday of Charles Robert Darwin. Since this first Darwin Day, the annual celebration has grown to include an annual keynote speaker, a teacher's workshop, and other events.

# 2021: Safely together!

**Biodiversity Viewing Party**: We will all watch together the first episode of the nature documentary Our Planet, after an introduction by Dr. Laura Russo about biodiversity. Dr. Russo's talk is streamed here (link to follow); our zoom for discussion during the video is at here (link to follow). The documentary can be seen on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80049832) and on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/GfO-3Oir-qM). We also embed it below:

**Evolution Game Online AND Reddit AMA**: We will play the online game [Evolution](https://www.evolutiondigitalgame.com/) (free to play, though purchases our available) as well as have an online panel on Reddit to ask questions about evolution, especially those inspired by the game. [Note we have no affiliation with the game or its creators -- it's just something that has worked well for us as a board game and which is fun and useful online, too]

**Evolution Bake Off**: Use the hashtag `#evolutionbakes` to tag a biodiversity or evolution inspired baked creation on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram: Dodo Donuts, Trilo-Bites, Kludgie the Legged Whale ice cream cake. Use your imagination!

# 2019: Keynote [Dr. Alan Templeton](https://pages.wustl.edu/templeton)

**Birthday party**: [Darwin's birthday party](https://news.utk.edu/2019/02/12/mcclung-museum-plans-family-activities-for-darwin-day/) was hosted at the McClung museum.

**Organizers**: Mali Hubert, Claire Winfrey, Clara Howell

# 2018: Keynote [Dr. Nizar Ibrahim](https://www.nizaribrahim.net/)

German/Moroccan paleontologist Nizar Ibrahim, a postdoctoral scholar in vertebrate anatomy and paleontology at the University of Chicago, scours the deserts of North Africa for clues to life in the Cretaceous period, when the area was a large river system teeming with a profusion of diverse life. In addition to unearthing many huge dinosaur bones, he has discovered fossil footprints and a new species of flying reptile with an 18-foot wingspan that lived 95 million years ago. His upcoming paper describing the ecosystem of what is now Morocco's Sahara Desert in the mid-Cretaceous period will be a milestone, providing the most detailed account of the diversity, paleoecology, and geologic context of fossil vertebrates from North Africa. His description is especially important, since northern Africa and the mid-Cretaceous period are underexplored and underrepresented in paleontology. "We found an entire lost world; a window on a moment of major evolutionary change," he says. Nizar Ibrahim was named a National Geographic Emerging Explorer in 2014.

**Birthday party**: Darwin's birthday party was hosted at the McClung museum.
